    <para>
      OPENSSL_Applink is application-side interface which provides a glue
      between OpenSSL BIO layer and Win32 compiler run-time environment.
      Even though it appears at application side, it's essentially OpenSSL
      private interface. For this reason application developers are not
      expected to implement it, but to compile provided module with
      compiler of their choice and link it into the target application. The
      referred module is available as <filename>applink.c</filename>,
      located alongside the public header files (only on the platforms
      where applicable).
