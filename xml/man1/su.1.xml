    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <command>su</command> command is used to become another user during
      a login session. Invoked without a <option>username</option>, 
      <command>su</command> defaults to
      becoming the superuser. The optional argument <option>-</option> may
      be used to provide an environment similar to what the user would
      expect had the user logged in directly.
    </para>

    <para>
      Additional arguments may be provided after the username, in which case
      they are supplied to the user's login shell. In particular, an
      argument of <option>-c</option> will cause the next argument to be
      treated as a command by most command interpreters. The command will be
      executed by the shell specified in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>
      for the target user.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use the <option>--</option> argument to separate
      <command>su</command> options from the arguments supplied to the shell.
    </para>

    <para>The user will be prompted for a password, if appropriate. Invalid
      passwords will produce an error message. All attempts, both valid and
      invalid, are logged to detect abuse of the system.
    </para>

    <para>
      The current environment is passed to the new shell. The value of
      <envar>$PATH</envar> is reset to <filename>/bin:/usr/bin</filename>
      for normal users, or <filename>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</filename>
      for the superuser. This may be changed with the
      <option>ENV_PATH</option> and <option>ENV_SUPATH</option>
      definitions in <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the first
      character of the login shell. The given home directory will be used as
      the root of a new file system which the user is actually logged into.
