    <para>
      The <command>pwconv</command> command creates <emphasis remap="I">shadow</emphasis> from <emphasis remap="I">passwd</emphasis>
      and an optionally existing <emphasis remap="I">shadow</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para condition="tcb">
      <command>pwconv</command> does not work with
      <option>USE_TCB</option> enabled. To convert to tcb passwords, you
      should first use <command>pwconv</command> to convert to shadowed
      passwords by disabling <option>USE_TCB</option> in
      <filename>login.defs</filename> and then convert to tcb password
      using <command>tcb_convert</command> (and re-enable
      <option>USE_TCB</option> in <filename>login.defs</filename>.)
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>pwunconv</command> command creates <emphasis remap="I">passwd</emphasis> from <emphasis remap="I">passwd</emphasis>
      and <emphasis remap="I">shadow</emphasis> and then removes <emphasis remap="I">shadow</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para condition="tcb">
      <command>pwunconv</command> does not work with
      <option>USE_TCB</option> enabled. You should first switch back from
      tcb to shadowed passwords using <command>tcb_unconvert</command>,
      and then disable <option>USE_TCB</option> in
      <filename>login.defs</filename> before using
      <command>pwunconv</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>grpconv</command> command creates <emphasis remap="I">gshadow</emphasis> from <emphasis remap="I">group</emphasis>
      and an optionally existing <emphasis remap="I">gshadow</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>grpunconv</command> command creates <emphasis remap="I">group</emphasis> from <emphasis remap="I">group</emphasis>
      and <emphasis remap="I">gshadow</emphasis> and then removes <emphasis remap="I">gshadow</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and
      group files: <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>,
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>, <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>, and
      <filename>/etc/gshadow</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion. 
      <command>pwconv</command> and <command>grpconv</command> are similar. 
      First, entries in the shadowed file which don't exist in the main file
      are removed. Then, shadowed entries which don't have `x' as the
      password in the main file are updated. Any missing shadowed entries
      are added. Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with `x'. 
      These programs can be used for initial conversion as well to update
      the shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>pwconv</command> will use the values of <emphasis remap="I">PASS_MIN_DAYS</emphasis>, <emphasis remap="I">PASS_MAX_DAYS</emphasis>, and <emphasis remap="I">PASS_WARN_AGE</emphasis> from
      <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename> when adding new entries to
      <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Likewise <command>pwunconv</command> and <command>grpunconv</command>
      are similar. Passwords in the main file are updated from the shadowed
      file. Entries which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed
      file are left alone. Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some
      password aging information is lost by <command>pwunconv</command>. It
      will convert what it can.

      Errors in the password or group files (such as invalid or duplicate
      entries) may cause these programs to loop forever or fail in other

      <command>grpck</command> to correct any such errors before converting

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new
      group entry (line) is started in <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      (with the same name, same password, and same GID).
    </para>
    <para>
      The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the
      number of members in a group.
    </para>
    <!-- Note: on HP, split groups have the same ID, but different
               names. -->
    <para>
      This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in
      the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS
      groups are not larger than 1024 characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the
      Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable unless you really
      need it.
