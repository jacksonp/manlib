      <para>
	When invoked without the <option>-D</option> option, the
	<command>useradd</command> command creates a new user account using
	the values specified on the command line plus the default values from
	the system. Depending on command line options, the
	<command>useradd</command> command
	will update system files and may also create the new user's home
	directory and copy initial files.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see
	<option>-g</option>, <option>-N</option>, <option>-U</option>, and
