    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <command>sulogin</command> command is invoked by <command>init</command>
      prior to allowing the user access to the system when in single user mode.
      This feature may only be available on certain systems where
      <command>init</command> has been modified accordingly, or where the
      <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> has an entry for a single user
      login.
    </para>

    <para>The user is prompted</para>

    <para>Type control-d to proceed with normal startup,
      <!-- .br -->
      (or give root password for system maintenance):
    </para>

    <para>
      Input and output will be performed with the standard file descriptors
      unless the optional device name argument is provided.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the user enters the correct root password, a login session is
      initiated. When <emphasis>EOF</emphasis> is pressed instead, the
      system enters multi-user mode.
    </para>

    <para>
      After the user exits the single-user shell, or presses
      <emphasis>EOF</emphasis>, the system begins the initialization process
      required to enter multi-user mode.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 xml:id="caveats">
    <title>CAVEATS</title>
    <para>
      This command can only be used if <command>init</command> has been
      modified to call <command>sulogin</command> instead of
      <filename>/bin/sh</filename>, or if the user has set the <emphasis remap="I">inittab</emphasis> to support a single user login. For
      example, the line:
    </para>

    <para>co:s:respawn:/etc/sulogin /dev/console</para>

    <para>should execute the sulogin command in single user mode.</para>

    <para>
      As complete an environment as possible is created. However, various
      devices may be unmounted or uninitialized and many of the user
      commands may be unavailable or nonfunctional as a result.
