    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <command>chgpasswd</command> command reads a list of group name
      and password pairs from standard input and uses this information to
      update a set of existing groups. Each line is of the format:
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis remap="I">group_name</emphasis>:<emphasis remap="I">password</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      By default the supplied password must be in clear-text, and is
      encrypted by <command>chgpasswd</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default encryption algorithm can be defined for the system with
      the <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option> variable of <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename>,
      and can be overwiten with the <option>-e</option>,
      <option>-m</option>, or <option>-c</option> options.
    </para>
    <para>
      This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
      where many accounts are created at a single time.

      This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in
      the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS
      groups are not larger than 1024 characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

      Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable unless you really
