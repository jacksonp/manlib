    <para>
      The <command>newusers</command> command reads a <replaceable>file</replaceable> (or the standard input by default)
      and uses this information to update a set
      of existing users or to create new users. Each line is in the same format
      as the standard password file (see
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>passwd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>) with the exceptions explained below:
