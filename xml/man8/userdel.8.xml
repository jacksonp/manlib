      This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in
      the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS
      groups are not larger than 1024 characters.
    </para>

      If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

      Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable unless you really
      need it.
