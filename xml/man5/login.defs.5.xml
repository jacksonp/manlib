    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename> file defines the
      site-specific configuration for the shadow password suite. This file
      is required. Absence of this file will not prevent system operation,
      but will probably result in undesirable operation.
    </para>

    <para>
      This file is a readable text file, each line of the file describing
      one configuration parameter. The lines consist of a configuration name
      and value, separated by whitespace. Blank lines and comment lines are
      ignored. Comments are introduced with a "#" pound sign and the pound
      sign must be the first non-white character of the line.
    </para>

    <para>
      Parameter values may be of four types: strings, booleans, numbers, and
      long numbers. A string is comprised of any printable characters. A
      boolean should be either the value <replaceable>yes</replaceable> or
      <replaceable>no</replaceable>. An undefined boolean
      parameter or one with a value other than these will be given a
      <replaceable>no</replaceable>
      value. Numbers (both regular and long) may be either decimal values,
      octal values (precede the value with <replaceable>0</replaceable>) or
      hexadecimal values
      (precede the value with <replaceable>0x</replaceable>).
      The maximum value of the regular and
      long numeric parameters is machine-dependent.
    </para>

    <para>The following configuration items are provided:</para>

      Much of the functionality that used to be provided by the shadow
      password suite is now handled by PAM. Thus,

      <refentrytitle>passwd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>, or less used by <citerefentry>

      <refentrytitle>su</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
