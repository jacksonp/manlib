.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fallocate
is used to manipulate the allocated disk space for a file, either to deallocate
or preallocate it. For filesystems which support the fallocate system call,
preallocation is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as
uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks. This is much faster than
creating a file by filling it with zeros.
.PP
As of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call is supported by the
btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs filesystems. Support for options needed to run with
\fI\-\-punch-hole\fR or \fI\-\-detect-holes\fR was added in Linux 2.6.38.
.PP
The exit code returned by
.B fallocate
is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

.SH OPTIONS
The \fIlength\fR and \fIoffset\fR arguments may be followed by the multiplicative
suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB
(the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes
KB=1000, MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-keep-size\fP"
Do not modify the apparent length of the file.  This may effectively allocate
blocks past EOF, which can be removed with a truncate.
.IP "\fB\-p, \-\-punch-hole\fP"
Punch holes in the file, the range should not exceed the length of the file.
This option may not be specified at the same time as the
.B \-z
option.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-dig-holes\fP"
Detect and dig holes. Makes the file sparse in-place, without using extra disk
space. The minimal size of the hole depends on filesystem I/O block size
(usually 4096 bytes). Also, when using this option, \fI\-\-keep-size\fP is
implied.
.PP
.IP
You can think of this as doing a "\fBcp --sparse\fP" and
renaming the dest file as the original, without the need for extra disk space.
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-collapse-range\fP"
Collapse a particular file range to nullify the hole. Extents beyond the range
[offset, offset+length] will be shifted to the beginning of hole. Hence this
command does not leave a hole, while \fI\-\-punch-hole\fP leaves a hole
instead of shifting extents. Both offset and length should be aligned to
the block size of filesystem.
.IP "\fB\-z, \-\-zero-range\fP"
Zero range in the file. Regions that span holes in the file will be
preallocated, this includes areas past EOF. Option
.B \-n
can be specified to prevent file length modification. Reads from the range
will return zeros. This option may not be specified at the same time as the
.B \-p
or
.B \-c
option.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-offset\fP \fIoffset\fP
Specifies the beginning offset of the allocation, in bytes.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-length\fP \fIlength\fP
Specifies the length of the allocation, in bytes.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Display help text and exit.
.IP "\fB-v, \-\-verbose"
Enable verbose mode.
.IP "\fB-V, \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
